This is not a complex code.

I just needed something to organize my videos in video tags so I could stream them in a discord server cause windows' default video player wasn't showing up in the programs to stream.

It takes any folder in it's root directory and reads all of their contents paths and use as source to video tags dividing them in the web page by the folder name and adding the file's name under the video tag.
